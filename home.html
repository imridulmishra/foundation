                        established in
                        2019 by
                        Brit-Indian philanthropist, entrepreneur and Film maker Deana Uppal. Our dedicated team of
                        individuals are committed to supporting the needs of poverty struck communities. Currently, we
                        are focusing our support in and around the Jaipur area of Rajasthan, India. We also have been
                        collaborating on projects internationally. We work with local schools to provide access to
                        education to children who would otherwise not have access. We also offer vocational education to
                        adults to equip them with marketable skills that increase their chances of employment enabling
                        them to support themselves and their families.</p>

                    lives. The
                    Kindness Diaries
                    Trust team holds the conviction that education plays a vital role in overcoming the poverty that at
                    least 25% of children in Jaipur face at birth. We are committed to making education accessible to
                    all. In addition to our focus on education, we recognise the importance of addressing other basic
                    needs, such as health care, clothing and food. We provide these necessities to a large number of
                    poverty struck areas. Our food distributions feed hundreds of people every week. During the COVID
                    pandemic, our committed team in Jaipur oversaw the distribution of thousands of PPE kits. We worked
                    hard to get our hands on many oxygen machines to help patients in dire need. Our team installed
                    oxygen machines for COVID-19 patients who were unable to secure a hospital bed due to the high
                    volume of inpatients at the time. Our experienced medical team helped to save many lives—our efforts
                    were acknowledged and appreciated by the local authorities and government. At Kindness Diaries
                    Trust, we believe any act of kindness can make the most significant difference.</p>
